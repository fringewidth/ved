# Ved: A Website for Research Collaboration

Ved is a student project aimed at promoting research collaboration. It is intended to serve as a platform where users can browse and interact with various research projects, papers, and authors.


## How I made this:
- [Designed the UI in Figma.]( https://www.figma.com/design/5Ny5Yu47TOpQf5muyH2aL3/Ved-(Copy)?node-id=0-1&t=RiyZcHey26Bb8L04-1)
- Built the front-end using React and vanilla CSS (yes really)
- Configured a Postgres database to store data.
- Used Supabase for authentication and for the ORM
- Populated the database with dummy data generated by Mistral. 

## Some Technical Details
- The application supports basic authentication, allowing users to create an account, log in, and log out.
- CRUD operations are supported, allowing users to create new projects, view project details, update user information, and delete projects.
- The application includes a search functionality, enabling users to easily find specific projects or other users.
- There are over 100 fake users. (thanks Mistral)
